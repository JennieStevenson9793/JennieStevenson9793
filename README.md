## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm a passionate game developer specializing in creating both 2D and 3D games using Unity and C#. This repository showcases my ongoing and completed projects, each one focused on delivering engaging gameplay experiences through solid mechanics, responsive controls, and immersive environments.

My approach to game development centers around game mechanicsâ€”from player movement and enemy AI to combat systems, puzzles, and platforming challenges. Every feature is carefully crafted with clean, modular C# code that emphasizes clarity and reusability. Whether I'm building a fast-paced action game or a slow-burn exploration experience, the core mechanics are always the priority.

In addition to gameplay systems, I put a strong focus on physics integration using Unity's built-in physics engine. Whether simulating realistic object interactions in 3D or designing tight collision detection in 2D, I strive to create believable and consistent in-game worlds. Rigidbodies, colliders, raycasting, and custom physics-based behaviors all play a role in my toolkit.

Project organization is a key part of my workflow. You'll find clearly structured folders separating scripts, scenes, prefabs, assets, and documentation. I follow consistent naming conventions and use version control to manage changes and collaborate effectively when working in teams. Readme files, inline comments, and commit messages help make each project as transparent and developer-friendly as possible.

Feel free to explore the repository, check out different branches, or fork a project to make it your own. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, collaboration, or just chatting about game design. Thanks for stopping byâ€”and happy coding!
